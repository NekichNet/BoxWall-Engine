# BoxWall-Engine

A game engine includes isometric camera class implemented with glfw library, level-by-level gameplay, easy customizable physics for simple shaped objects, input-listener, and editor app for objects, structures and levels.

I prefer GLFW as graphic library and [FMOD-Audio-Engine](https://github.com/rosshoyt/FMOD-Audio-Engine) because of simple implementation and due to the amount of reference material.

You can track developing progress with [Kanban board](https://evstropov.kaiten.ru/space/538381/boards).
